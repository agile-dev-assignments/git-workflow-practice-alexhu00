## Main Points I Found Interesting

### 1. Volkswagen Consolidating their Autonomous Vehicle Departments

- Prior to this year, Volkswagen had been working on both self-driving cars for the longer term future and driver-assistance features like cruise control modes for the shorter term future.
- Last year, Volkswagen combined these subsidiaries into one subsidiary called Car.Software so that there would be more of a cohesive feel between the software
- This new deal with Microsoft now means that everyone in the subsidiary while now be using the same common cloud provider as there were certain groups within the subsidiaries that had been using different systems for development.
- I think this will be great for Volkswagen employees in the subsidiary so that now they can all be on the same page

### 2. More Seamless "Over-The-Air" Updates

- The deal with Microsoft will also allow Volkswagen to deploy new software updates to their cars more easily
- This means that Volkswagen cars that hit the road today will have access to future capabilities that are added over time which could bring them closer to being autonomous vehicles
- I think this is great news for Volkswagen as it makes them more competitive with Telsa who is known for their "Over-The-Air" software updates.
